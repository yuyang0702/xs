## Usage

Relationships are bidirectional. When adding a relationship to one character, add the inverse to the other:

- If A has `type: parent` to B, then B has `type: child` to A
- If A has `type: mentor` to B, then B has `type: student` to A
- If A has `type: rival` to B, then B has `type: rival` to A (symmetric)

Inverse pairs:
- parent <-> child
- grandparent <-> grandchild
- uncle/aunt <-> nephew/niece
- mentor <-> student
- employer <-> subordinate

Symmetric types (same both ways):
- sibling, spouse, partner, friend, ally, rival, enemy, cousin, colleague, foil, confidant, love-interest
